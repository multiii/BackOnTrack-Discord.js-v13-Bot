 * and the other contains all elements that do not satisfy `predicate`.
 * @param array The array to partition. This array is not mutated.
 * @param predicate The predicate function to determine in which partition the item should be placed.
 * The function should return true for items that should be placed in the first partition, and false for those that should be placed in the second partition.
 * @returns A tuple of two arrays.
