 * cancel delayed invocations and a flush method to immediately invoke them. Provide an options object to
 * indicate that func should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the wait timeout. Subsequent
 * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last func invocation.
 *
 * Note: If leading and trailing options are true, func is invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only
 * if the the debounced function is invoked more than once during the wait timeout.
 *
 * See David Corbachoâ€™s article for details over the differences between _.debounce and _.throttle.

 * @param func The function to debounce.
 * @param wait The number of milliseconds to delay.
 * @param options The options object.
 * @return Returns the new debounced function.
